# A04:2021 – Insecure Design
A new category for 2021 focusing on risks related to design flaws and architectural gaps.

### Summary
Insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation; the threat model was flawed from the start.

### Prevention
Use "Secure Development Lifecycle" (SDL) and establish a library of secure design patterns.
